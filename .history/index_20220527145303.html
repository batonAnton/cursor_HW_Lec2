    <h1>Google IO 2022</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Google IO is first and foremost a developers' event for people who make apps for the company's many operating systems like Android, Chrome OS and Wear OS, but it's worth paying attention to even if you're not a developer, as we usually see the debut of new hardware and software, which happened at the event.</p>
