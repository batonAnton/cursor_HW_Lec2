    <h1>Google IO 2022</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Google IO is first and foremost a developers' event for people who make apps for the company's many operating systems like <span>Android</span>  , <span>Chrome OS</span>  and <span>Wear OS</span>, but it's worth paying attention to even if you're not a developer, as we usually see the debut of new hardware and software, which happened at the event.</p>

    <h3>How Google IO 2022 worked?</h3>
    <p> Most casual Google users associate Google IO with the keynote address, which streams online where anyone can    watch it. But in previous years you could also buy a pass to attend Google developer sessions, new product demos, labs to learn about new code, and other events for professionals or hobbyists.

    <p>Based on Google's annual product and software calendar, plus all the leaks and rumors we've heard about, here's a quick roundup of what Sundar Pichai and the Google execs discussed during the Google IO 2022 keynote:</p>
